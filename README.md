# README generator

## Coding Bootcamp week 09 challenge

This is a command line application which creates a README md file for the user based on a series of prompts in the command line. The user initialises the application by typing node index.js in the terminal command line. The user is then presented with a series of prompts to obtain the information required to create the README file. After entering all the required inputs the application will generate a README md document which will be written to the output folder within the application folder. The README will include badges for the required license, a screenshot of the application, and links to the deployed application and Github repository.
This is the first challenge I have created using node.js and the first time I have used inquirer. This has been a consolidation of all the back-end concepts that have been introduced in the past week.

### Installation

The user is required to type 'npm install' in the command line to install requried node modules. The application is then initialised in the terminal by the command 'node index.js'.

### Usage

This application generates a markdown README file based on the users inputs. The README file is written to the output folder in the README-generator application folder.
